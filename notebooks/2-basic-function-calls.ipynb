    "Let's walk through the fundamentals of building a basic agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, agents aren't magical ‚Äî they are just LLMs augmented with the ability to call external tools when needed.  \n",
    "In fact, a very simple agent is often just **an LLM in a while loop**, deciding when to call tools based on what the user asks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key concepts we'll cover:\n",
    "- **Function Definition**: What tools the LLM can access.\n",
    "- **Function Call**: A special output from the model indicating that a tool should be used.\n",
    "- **Function Response**: The result we get from executing that tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "To tie all of this together, we'll build a minimal **LLM Framework** that wraps around the model's outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also relate this to a broader view:  \n",
    "In more complex systems, agents often combine **retrieval**, **tools**, and **memory** ‚Äî but at the core, the pattern remains the same:  \n",
    "The LLM outputs a call, and the framework decides what to do next."
